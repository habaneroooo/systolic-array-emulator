<H2 class="chapter">81 GtkFileChooser</H2>

<P>File chooser interface used by GtkFileChooserWidget and GtkFileChooserDialog

</P><H3 class="section">81.1 Overview</H3>

<P><CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser&gt;</CODE> is an interface that can be implemented by file
selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this interface are
<CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-widget&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-dialog&gt;</CODE>, and
<CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-button&gt;</CODE>. You do not need to write an object that
implements the <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser&gt;</CODE> interface unless you are trying to
adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming interface.

   </P><P><CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser&gt;</CODE> allows for shortcuts to various places in the
filesystem. In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. 
It may be a bit confusing at first taht these shortcuts come from various
sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

     </P><DL>
<DT><VAR>Shortcuts</VAR></DT><DD>
<!-- %start of fragment -->

     <!-- %end of fragment -->
     <BR></DD><DT><VAR>Volumes</VAR></DT><DD>
<!-- %start of fragment -->

     <!-- %end of fragment -->
   </DD></DL>

   <P>are created by the user, by dragging folders from the right pane to the left
pane, or by using the "Add". Bookmarks can be renamed and deleted by the user.

   </P><P>can be provided by the application or by the underlying filesystem abstraction
(e.g. both the gnome-vfs and the Windows filesystems provide "Desktop"
shortcuts). Shortcuts cannot be modified by the user.

   </P><P>are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are the "roots" of
the filesystem.

</P><H3 class="section">81.2 File Names and Encodings</H3>

<P>When the user is finished selecting files in a <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser&gt;</CODE>, your
program can get the selected names either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the
normal escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters. 
However, filenames are <EM>always</EM> returned in the character set specified by
the <SAMP><SPAN class="env">G_FILENAME_ENCODING</SPAN></SAMP> environment variable. Please see the Glib
documentation for more details about this variable.

   </P><P>This means that while you can pass the result of
<CODE>gtk-file-chooser-get-filename</CODE> to <CODE>open(2)</CODE> or <CODE>fopen(3)</CODE>, you
may not be able to directly set it as the text of a <CODE>&lt;gtk-label&gt;</CODE> widget
unless you convert it first to UTF-8, which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should
use <CODE>g-filename-to-utf8</CODE> to convert filenames into strings that can be
passed to GTK+ widgets.

</P><H3 class="section">81.3 Adding a Preview Widget</H3>

<P>You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then get notification
about when the preview needs to be updated. To install a preview widget, use
<CODE>gtk-file-chooser-set-preview-widget</CODE>. Then, connect to the
<CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser::update-preview&gt;</CODE> signal to get notified when you need
to update the contents of the preview.

   </P><P>Your callback should use <CODE>gtk-file-chooser-get-preview-filename</CODE> to see
what needs previewing. Once you have generated the preview for the corresponding
file, you must call <CODE>gtk-file-chooser-set-preview-widget-active</CODE> with a
boolean flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully generate a
preview.

</P><PRE class="example">     
     {
       GtkImage *preview;
     
       ...
     
       preview = gtk_image_new ();
     
       gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
       g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
     		    G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
     }
     
     static void
     update_preview_cb (GtkFileChooser *file_chooser, gpointer data)
     {
       GtkWidget *preview;
       char *filename;
       GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
       gboolean have_preview;
     
       preview = GTK_WIDGET (data);
       filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename (file_chooser);
     
       pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size (filename, 128, 128, NULL);
       have_preview = (pixbuf != NULL);
       g_free (filename);
     
       gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE (preview), pixbuf);
       if (pixbuf)
         gobject_unref (pixbuf);
     
       gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active (file_chooser, have_preview);
     }
     
</PRE>
   <H3 class="section">81.4 Adding Extra Widgets</H3>

<P>You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options that are not
present in the default design. For example, you can add a toggle button to give
the user the option to open a file in read-only mode. You can use
<CODE>gtk-file-chooser-set-extra-widget</CODE> to insert additional widgets in a file
chooser.

</P><PRE class="example">     
     {
       GtkWidget *toggle;
     
       ...
     
       toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
       gtk_widget_show (toggle);
       gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
     }
     
</PRE>
   <P>If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file chooser, you can a
container such as a GtkVBox or a GtkTable and include your widgets in it. Then,
set the container as the whole extra widget.

</P><H3 class="section">81.5 Key Bindings</H3>

<P>Internally, GTK+ implements a file chooser's graphical user interface with the
private . This widget has several key bindings and their associated signals. 
This section describes the available key binding signals.

   </P><P>The default keys that activate the key-binding signals in are as follows:

   </P><P>Both the individual key and the numeric keypad's "divide" key are supported.

   </P><P>Both the individual Up key and the numeric keypad's Up key are supported.

   </P><P>You can change these defaults to something else. For example, to add a modifier
to a few of the default bindings, you can include the following fragment in your
<SAMP><SPAN class="file">.gtkrc-2.0</SPAN></SAMP> file:

</P><PRE class="example">     
     binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings" {
     	bind "&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;Up" {
     		"up-folder" ()
     	}
     	bind "&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;Down" {
     		"down-folder" ()
     	}
     	bind "&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;Home" {
     		"home-folder" ()
     	}
     }
     
     class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings"

   <H4 class="subsection">81.5.1 The "GtkFileChooserDefault::location-popup" signal</H4>

                                   gpointer user_data);
     
</PRE>
   <P>This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" dialog which the user
can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select. The
<VAR>path</VAR> argument is a string that gets put in the text entry for the file
name. By default this is bound to with a <VAR>path</VAR> string of "" (the empty
string). It is also bound to with a <VAR>path</VAR> string of "‘<SAMP><SPAN class="samp">/</SPAN></SAMP>’" (a slash):
this lets you type and immediately type a path name. On Unix systems, this is
bound to (tilde) with a <VAR>path</VAR> string of "~" itself for access to home
directories.

   </DD></DL>

   <P>You can create your own bindings for the signal with custom <VAR>path</VAR> strings,
and have a crude form of easily-to-type bookmarks. For example, say you access
the path <SAMP><SPAN class="file">/home/username/misc</SPAN></SAMP> very frequently. You could then create an
shortcut by including the following in your <SAMP><SPAN class="file">.gtkrc-2.0</SPAN></SAMP>:

</P><PRE class="example">     
     binding "misc-shortcut" {
     	bind "&lt;Alt&gt;M" {

</PRE>
   <P>This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the current folder in the
file hierarchy. The subfolder that will be used is displayed in the path bar
widget of the file chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing
"/foo/<EM>bar/</EM>baz", then this will cause the file chooser to switch to the
"baz" subfolder. By default this is bound to (the Down key in the numeric keypad
also works).

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This signal is emitted when the current folder in a <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser&gt;</CODE>

        </P><P>A signal handler for this signal must return a
<CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-confirmation&gt;</CODE> value, which indicates the action to
take. If the handler determines that the user wants to select a different
filename, it should return <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-confirmation-select-again&gt;</CODE>. 
If it determines that the user is satisfied with his choice of file name, it
should return <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-confirmation-accept-filename&gt;</CODE>. On the
other hand, if it determines that the stock confirmation dialog should be used,
it should return <CODE>&lt;gtk-file-chooser-confirmation-confirm&gt;</CODE>. The following
example illustrates this.
