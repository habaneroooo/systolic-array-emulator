{}	: groups operations and execute them in order (left to right) in one systolic cycle.
,	: separates operations when queued with brackets

<x	: Charge data. "x" is either "L" or "U".
>x	: Ouput data. "x" is either "R" or "D"
	  When queued in brackets, order does not matter, it is always the last operation executed.
	  If not defined, it returns the result of the last operation

(t,x,y,o)	: indicates the data to process, their format and where to store the result. It is ignored for ø (= void).<br>
		
Ex: 
/(x,y) divide x by y, stores the result in o. Default stores it in the temporary register.<br>
		"t" indicates the type of data. <br>
		Data can be:<br>
		"ul","sl": unsigned/signed long int<br>
		"f": floating point
		"ud","sd": 8bit signed/unsigned int<br>
		"us","ss": 16bit signed/unsigned int<br>
		Default is signed long int.<br>
