|| { || groups operations and execute them in order (left to right) in one systolic cycle. ||
|| , || separates operations when queued with brackets ||
|| <x ||Charge data. "x" is either "L" or "U". ||
|| >x ||Ouput data. "x" is either "R" or "D"<br>When queued in brackets, order does not matter, it is always the last operation executed. ||
	  If not defined, it returns the result of the last operation

= Syntax =

(t,x,y,o)	: indicates the data to process, their format and where to store the result. It is ignored for ø (= void).<br>
		
Ex: 
/(x,y) divide x by y, stores the result in o. Default stores it in the temporary register.<br>
		"t" indicates the type of data. <br>
		Data can be:<br>
		"ul","sl": unsigned/signed long int<br>
		"f": floating point
		"ud","sd": 8bit signed/unsigned int<br>
		"us","ss": 16bit signed/unsigned int<br>
		Default is signed long int.<br>
